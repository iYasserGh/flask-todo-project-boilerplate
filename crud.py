    prompt = """Create a new todo item based on the following description. Provide a concise title and an optional detailed description. The todo should be actionable and clear.
    Description: {description}
    Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
{{
    \"title\": \"A concise title for the todo\",
    \"description\": \"A summary description of the todo\",
    \"summary\": [\"A list of points summary of the todo\"],
    \"date\": \"A formatted date string like 'Mar 10 2026', if date not mentioned in the description, make it today's date\",

For example, this is two different descriptions and the expected output:
Description: "Organize a community clean-up event at the local park next Saturday. We need volunteers to help with picking up trash, setting up stations for recycling, and providing refreshments. The event will run from 9 AM to 1 PM. We also need someone to create flyers and promote the event on social media."
Expected Output:
{{
    \"title\": \"Community Clean-Up Event\",
    \"description\": \"Organize a clean-up event at the local park next Saturday. Volunteers needed for trash pickup, recycling stations, and refreshments. Need someone to create flyers and promote on social media.\",
    \"summary\": [\"Organize a clean-up event at the local park\",
        \"Date: Next Saturday, 9 AM to 1 PM\",
        \"Volunteers needed for trash pickup, recycling stations, and refreshments\",
        \"Need someone to create flyers and promote on social media\"],
    \"date\": \"Mar 15 2026\",
    \"variant\": \"wide\",
    \"volunteersNeeded\": 10,
    \"priority\": 4
}}

Description: "Fix the leaking faucet in the kitchen. The faucet has been dripping for a week and it's getting worse. We need to replace the washer and check if there are any other issues with the plumbing. This is a high priority task as it's causing water wastage and increasing our water bill."
Expected Output:
{{
    \"title\": \"Fix Leaking Faucet\",
    \"description\": \"Fix the leaking faucet in the kitchen by replacing the washer and checking for other plumbing issues. This is a high priority task due to water wastage and increasing water bill.\",
    \"summary\": [\"Fix the leaking faucet in the kitchen\",
        \"Replace the washer\",
        \"Check for other plumbing issues\",
        \"High priority due to water wastage and increasing water bill\"],
    \"date\": \"Mar 10 2026\",
    \"variant\": \"small\",
    \"volunteersNeeded\": 1,
    \"priority\": 5
}}

notice we are in {current_time}, so the date should be generated accordingly if not mentioned in the description."""
